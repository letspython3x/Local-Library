<h3>List of Books</h3>
<p>Now let's redirect the root URL of our site (i.e. 127.0.0.1:8000) to the URL 127.0.0.1:8000/catalog/;
this is the only app we'll be using in this project, so we might as well.
To do this, we'll use a special view function (RedirectView),
which takes as its first argument the new relative URL to redirect to (/catalog/)
when the URL pattern specified in the path() function is matched (the root URL, in this case).</p>
